# Deep-Learning

Deep learning is the central technology behind a lot of high-end innovations like driverless cars, voice control in devices like tablets, smartphones, hands-free speakers etc and many more. It’s offering results which weren’t possible before or even with traditional machine learning techniques.

In this repository, you will find some deep learning models with their code. 

Repository will be updated with new models overtime.

Currently, it contains the following models:

- Classification_of_digits_from_MNIST
- Cats vs Dogs 
- Cats vs Dogs (with Large Dataset)
- CIFAR-10
- Face Detection using an Image (here comes OpenCV :wink:)
- Face Detection using Webcam (run program on local machine rather then Colab)


#### Until then, wait for more new models to come up :wink:
